For this project I did a game, with a bear dancing to the song "Pink and White" by Frank Ocean. THe game is similar to guitar hero, where the player uses the buttons "A", "S", "K", and "L" to try and earn points. Push the keyboard buttons when the falling dots overlap with their corresponding dots on the screen.

My custom shape was a pyramid. It can be seen as the hat on the bear's head and on the columns spinning.

I used the look_at() function at the beginning of my animation, when the camera goes from looking at the spinning pyramid to the bear. I also use it to zoom in on the bear at the end as he does his second dance move.
